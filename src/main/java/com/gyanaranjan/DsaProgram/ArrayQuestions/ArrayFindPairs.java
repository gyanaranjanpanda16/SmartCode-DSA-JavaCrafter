//You are given an array of integers. Write a Java method called findPairs that takes this array as
//        input and returns the count of pairs of integers in the array that sum up to a specified
//        target value. Each integer in the array can be used in multiple pairs if it satisfies the
//        condition.
//        For example  :->
//        given the array [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5] and the target value 10, the method
//        should return 3 because there are three pairs ((1, 9), (4, 6), and (5, 5)) whose sum is 10.
//        Your solution should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array.
//        Write the findPairs method along with any supporting methods or classes as needed.
