## Introduction

This repository serves as a learning resource for anyone looking to improve their knowledge and skills in Java and DSA. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews, enhancing your problem-solving abilities, or just brushing up on your Java programming skills, this repository is a valuable resource.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **src/main/java/dsa/**: Contains the implementation of various data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming).
- **src/main/java/practice/**: Contains practice programs that cover a wide range of topics in Java, from basic syntax to advanced concepts.
- **src/test/java/**: Includes test cases for the implementations and practice programs to ensure correctness and functionality.
- **docs/**: Contains additional documentation and resources to help you understand the concepts better.

## Getting Started

To get started with the repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
